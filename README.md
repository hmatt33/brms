# BRMS (Building and Resident Management System)
BRMS is a 3 tier web system using L.A.M.P built for a class project.

## The Team:
Our Group Name for this project is *OutOfTheBoxProgramming*. The Team consists of:

* Matthew Hunt (https://github.com/hmatt33)
* Sean Boyle (https://github.com/seboy96)
* James Bowbliss (https://github.com/JBowbliss)
* Faye Lopez (https://github.com/lopezk8)

## Purpose of System:
The Team is just beginning on the implementation stage of the project. BRMS is a websystem built with html,php,and mysql. This websystem is meant to use databases to keep track of multiple different buildings, and the residents who live there. This system is meant to be used by the employees of a realestate company, the only ones who will have a valid login is an employee. This system should let the company add/remove/edit a building's information, as well as add/remove/edit a resident's information. The system will allow the user to select a building, and be able to see a list of all residents within that building.

## Current Progress:

* Login ability is near completion, pages just need to be proofread and checked over by other group members
* buildings page was started but only has placeholder text, was only used to test login so far as the buildings page is where the user will be directed after login
* footer is near completion, may need additions
* stylesheet was created but nothing is in it at the moment
* mysql connection file was finished
* buildings page, new building form, residents page, new resident form still needs to be completed
